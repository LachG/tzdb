tzdb for Delphi XE and up
=========================

This fork of Alex Ciobanu's Delphi/FPC Time Zone Database Project removes support for FPC and Delphi versions earlier than Delphi XE but adds support for the nextgen mobile platforms.

Only the files in the TZDBPK folder are converted for use by the nextgen compiler, converting the other folders doesn't make a lot of practical sense.

All projects still work together whether they have been converted to nextgen or not.
